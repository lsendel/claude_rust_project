## Quick Summary

Sprint 4.5 successfully addressed the JwtUserInfoExtractor coverage gap identified in Sprint 4:

### Before Sprint 4.5:
- JwtUserInfoExtractor: **5% coverage** (4/81 instructions)
- Overall Backend: **88% coverage** (5,865/6,632 instructions)
- Total Tests: **636**

### After Sprint 4.5:
- JwtUserInfoExtractor: **100% coverage** ✅ (81/81 instructions)
- Overall Backend: **89% coverage** ✅ (5,942/6,632 instructions)
- Total Tests: **650** (+14 tests)

---

## JwtUserInfoExtractorTest.java (14 tests)

### Coverage Achieved:
- ✅ **Instruction Coverage**: 100% (81/81) - up from 5%
- ✅ **Branch Coverage**: 100% (4/4) - up from 0%
- ✅ **Line Coverage**: 100% (22/22) - up from 5%
- ✅ **Method Coverage**: 100% (4/4) - all methods tested
- ✅ **Complexity Coverage**: 100% (6/6)

### Test Categories:

**1. extractUserInfo() - Existing User (3 tests)**
- Extract user info for existing user
- Handle email_verified as false
- Handle missing email_verified claim (defaults to false)

**2. extractUserInfo() - New User (2 tests)**
- Create new user when user doesn't exist
- Create user with null name

**3. extractUserInfo() - Edge Cases (2 tests)**
- Handle JWT with minimal claims (subject only)
- Handle JWT with empty string claims

**4. extractCognitoUserId() (2 tests)**
- Extract Cognito user ID from JWT
- Extract Cognito user ID with special characters

**5. extractEmail() (3 tests)**
- Extract email from JWT
- Return null when email claim is missing
- Extract email with various formats (simple, plus addressing, subdomains)

**6. Integration Scenarios (2 tests)**
- Full user flow with all claims
- User creation with partial claims

## Key Testing Techniques

### JWT Token Mocking
Created helper methods to construct Spring Security JWT objects:

```java
private Jwt createJwt(String subject, String email, String name, Boolean emailVerified) {
    Map<String, Object> claims = new HashMap<>();
    if (email != null) claims.put("email", email);
    if (name != null) claims.put("name", name);
    if (emailVerified != null) claims.put("email_verified", emailVerified);

    // JWT requires at least one claim
    if (claims.isEmpty()) claims.put("sub", subject);

    return new Jwt("token-value", Instant.now(),
        Instant.now().plusSeconds(3600), headers, claims) {
        @Override
        public String getSubject() { return subject; }
    };
}
```

### Service Mocking
Mocked UserService to test both existing and new user scenarios:
- `getUserByCognitoId()` - returns existing user or throws exception
- `createUserFromCognito()` - creates new user from JWT claims
- `updateLastLogin()` - updates user's last login timestamp

## Coverage Improvement

| Component | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| JwtUserInfoExtractor Instructions | 5% (4/81) | **100%** (81/81) | **+95%** |
| JwtUserInfoExtractor Branches | 0% (0/4) | **100%** (4/4) | **+100%** |
| Overall Backend Coverage | 88% | **89%** | **+1%** |
| Total Tests | 636 | 650 | **+14** |

---

## Remaining Coverage Gaps

### SecurityConfig (config package) - 0% coverage
**Status**: Not addressed in Sprint 4.5
**Reason**: Requires Spring context (@SpringBootTest) for testing
**Impact**: 196 uncovered instructions (3% of codebase)
**Recommendation**: Address in future sprint if needed

### Other Gaps:
- Model classes: 68% coverage (low priority - mostly getters/setters)
- Security layer: Now 82% coverage (up from 67%)

## Test Execution

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=JwtUserInfoExtractorTest
# [INFO] Tests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

mvn clean test jacoco:report
# [INFO] Tests run: 650, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
# Coverage: 89%
```

## Sprint Timeline

- **Planning**: 5 minutes (reviewed Sprint 4 recommendations)
- **Test Development**: 30 minutes (created 14 comprehensive tests)
- **Debugging**: 10 minutes (fixed JWT empty claims issue)
- **Verification**: 5 minutes (ran tests, checked coverage)
- **Total**: **50 minutes**

---

## Key Achievements

1. ✅ **100% coverage** for JwtUserInfoExtractor (up from 5%)
2. ✅ **89% overall coverage** (up from 88%)
3. ✅ **14 comprehensive tests** covering all scenarios
4. ✅ **All 650 tests passing** (0 failures)
5. ✅ **Security layer coverage**: 82% (up from 67%)

---

## Files Created

- ✅ JwtUserInfoExtractorTest.java (14 tests, 398 lines)
- ✅ PMAT_SPRINT4.5_SUMMARY.md (this document)

---

## Conclusion

Sprint 4.5 successfully addressed the JwtUserInfoExtractor coverage gap identified in Sprint 4, achieving **100% coverage** for this critical security component. The overall backend coverage increased to **89%**, solidifying the project's strong test coverage foundation.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE - 100% COVERAGE ACHIEVED**

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

If further coverage improvements are desired:
1. **SecurityConfig testing** (196 instructions) - requires @SpringBootTest
2. **Model class testing** (low priority)
3. **Edge case scenarios** for existing services

**Current Status**: Project has excellent test coverage (89%) with strong foundations for future development.

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Clarifications Resolved

**1. Business Domain/Vertical** ✅
- **Decision**: Project Management
- **Details**: Business entities represent projects, tasks, and milestones with attributes including due dates, assignees, progress tracking, priority levels, and dependencies.

**2. Subscription Tiers and Quotas** ✅
- **Decision**: Three-tier model (Free: 50 projects/tasks, Pro: 1,000 projects/tasks, Enterprise: Unlimited)
- **Details**: Quota enforcement applies before entity creation with upgrade prompts when approaching limits.

**3. Multi-Tenant User Model** ✅
- **Decision**: Multiple tenants with automatic detection via URL
- **Details**: Users can belong to multiple tenants; tenant context extracted from subdomain (tenant1.platform.com) or path (platform.com/tenant1). No tenant switcher needed.

## Validation Status

✅ **PASSED** - All quality criteria met. Specification is ready for the next phase.

## Next Steps

The specification has passed all quality checks. You can now proceed to:
- `/speckit.plan` - Create a technical implementation plan
- Or optionally `/speckit.clarify` - If you need to ask additional clarifying questions before planning

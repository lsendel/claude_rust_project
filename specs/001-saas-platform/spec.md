# Feature Specification: Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-saas-platform`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Multi-tenant SaaS platform with Spring Boot backend, React frontend, AWS Lambda functions, and AWS infrastructure provisioning"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Tenant Administrator Sign-Up and Organization Setup (Priority: P1)

A tenant administrator creates an account for their organization and accesses the platform for the first time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core entry point for all customers. Without tenant sign-up and authentication, no other features can be used. It establishes the multi-tenancy foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering a new organization account, completing OAuth2 authentication via social providers (Google/Facebook/GitHub), and accessing the tenant dashboard. Delivers immediate value by enabling secure access to the platform.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they navigate to the sign-up page and choose to authenticate via Google, **Then** they are redirected to the OAuth2 provider, complete authentication, and land on their tenant dashboard with a new organization created.
2. **Given** a tenant administrator has completed sign-up, **When** they log out and return to the platform, **Then** they can re-authenticate using the same social provider and access their existing organization's data.
3. **Given** a tenant administrator attempts to sign up with an email already associated with another tenant, **Then** the system prevents duplicate tenant creation and prompts them to log into their existing account.

---

### User Story 2 - Core Business Entity Management (Priority: P2)

Authenticated users within a tenant can create, read, update, and delete business entities (e.g., Items, Projects, or Resources) specific to their organization.

**Why this priority**: This represents the primary value proposition of the SaaS platform—managing business data. It demonstrates multi-tenant data isolation and basic CRUD operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as a tenant user, creating multiple business entities, editing their properties, searching/filtering them, and verifying that users from different tenants cannot access each other's data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated tenant user, **When** they create a new business entity with required attributes, **Then** the entity is saved and appears in their tenant-specific entity list.
2. **Given** multiple entities exist for a tenant, **When** the user searches or filters by attributes, **Then** only matching entities within their tenant are displayed.
3. **Given** two different tenants (Tenant A and Tenant B), **When** Tenant A creates an entity, **Then** Tenant B cannot view, edit, or delete that entity through any interface.
4. **Given** a tenant user attempts to update an entity, **When** they provide invalid data (e.g., missing required fields), **Then** the system displays user-friendly validation errors and prevents the update.

---

### User Story 3 - Automated Per-Tenant Business Logic Execution (Priority: P3)

Tenant administrators can configure custom automation rules that trigger asynchronous processing when specific events occur within their organization.

**Why this priority**: This enables customization and extensibility per tenant, differentiating the platform from generic solutions. It leverages serverless functions for scalability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a simple automation rule (e.g., "send notification when new entity is created"), triggering the event, and verifying that the automation executes correctly and only affects the triggering tenant.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tenant administrator has configured an automation rule (e.g., "send email when entity status changes"), **When** an entity status changes within their tenant, **Then** the automation executes asynchronously and the configured action completes successfully.
2. **Given** Tenant A has an automation rule and Tenant B does not, **When** an event occurs in Tenant B, **Then** Tenant A's automation is not triggered and vice versa.
3. **Given** an automation fails during execution (e.g., external service unavailable), **When** the system detects the failure, **Then** the tenant administrator is notified and the failure is logged for troubleshooting.

---

### User Story 4 - Tenant User Invitation and Role Management (Priority: P3)

Tenant administrators can invite additional users to their organization and assign them roles with specific permissions.

**Why this priority**: Multi-user support is essential for team collaboration but can be implemented after core CRUD and authentication are working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by inviting a new user via email, having them complete sign-up through the invitation link, and verifying they have appropriate access based on their assigned role.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tenant administrator, **When** they invite a new user by email with a "Viewer" role, **Then** the invitee receives an email, completes registration, and can view but not modify tenant data.
2. **Given** a tenant user with "Viewer" role, **When** they attempt to delete an entity, **Then** the system denies the action and displays an appropriate permission error.
3. **Given** a tenant administrator, **When** they remove a user from their organization, **Then** that user can no longer access the tenant's data.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Free tier tenant attempts to create their 51st project (exceeding 50 limit)—is the creation blocked with an upgrade prompt?
- How does the system handle OAuth2 authentication failures or when a social provider is unavailable—fallback message or retry mechanism?
- What happens when an automation rule execution times out (30-second limit) or exceeds resource limits—is the tenant notified?
- How does the system handle concurrent updates to the same project by multiple users within a tenant—last-write-wins or optimistic locking?
- What happens when a tenant administrator deletes their account—are all tenant users and data immediately deleted or soft-deleted with a grace period?
- How does the system handle subdomain/path conflicts when creating a new tenant—is there uniqueness validation?
- What happens when a user accesses the platform via a generic URL (e.g., `platform.com`) without a tenant identifier—error page or tenant selection?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Key Entities

- **Tenant**: Represents an organization or customer account; contains metadata like name, subdomain/URL path, subscription tier (Free/Pro/Enterprise), creation date, and billing information.
- **User**: Represents an individual with authentication credentials; belongs to one or more tenants with tenant-specific roles.
- **Role**: Defines a set of permissions within a tenant (e.g., Administrator, Editor, Viewer); assigned to users per tenant.
- **Project/Task**: Core domain object managed by tenants for project management; contains attributes including name, description, status, due date, assignees, progress percentage, priority level, and dependencies to other projects/tasks.
- **Automation Rule**: Tenant-specific configuration defining event triggers and actions (e.g., "when entity status changes, send notification").
- **Event**: Domain event published when significant actions occur (e.g., entity created, user invited); consumed by automation functions.

## Assumptions

- OAuth2 social identity providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub) are available and have stable APIs.
- Tenant users have modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript enabled.
- Each tenant has a unique identifier that is immutable and can be reliably extracted from authenticated user sessions.
- Multi-tenant data isolation will be implemented using a discriminator column approach (tenant ID in each table) rather than separate databases per tenant.
- Automation rules will be limited in complexity and execution time to prevent abuse (e.g., 30-second timeout, no infinite loops).
- The platform will initially support B2B use cases with organizations as tenants, not B2C with individual users as tenants.
- Billing and subscription management will be handled externally (out of scope for this feature).
- Infrastructure will be provisioned on AWS using infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/CDK/SAM).
- Development environment uses containerized services (Docker) for local testing before deploying to AWS.

## Dependencies

- AWS Cognito for OAuth2 authentication and user management.
- AWS Lambda for executing tenant-specific automation rules.
- AWS EventBridge or SQS for event-driven architecture and asynchronous processing.
- Relational database (AWS RDS) or NoSQL database (DynamoDB) for persistent storage.
- AWS S3 and CloudFront for hosting the React frontend.
- AWS API Gateway or Application Load Balancer for routing API requests to the Spring Boot backend.
- Infrastructure-as-code tooling (Terraform, AWS CDK, or SAM) for provisioning AWS resources.
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar) for automated testing and deployment.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Multi-tenant authentication via OAuth2 (AWS Cognito) with social identity providers.
- REST API for CRUD operations on business entities with multi-tenant data isolation.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with tenant-specific roles and permissions.
- React frontend with responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers.
- Asynchronous automation rules triggered by domain events using AWS Lambda.

- White-labeling or custom branding per tenant (future enhancement).
- Mobile native applications (iOS/Android)—only responsive web interface.
- Third-party integrations (e.g., Slack, Salesforce) beyond OAuth2 providers.
- Multi-region deployment and data residency requirements (single AWS region assumed).
- Advanced automation rule scripting or Turing-complete custom code execution (limited to predefined actions).
- Data migration tools for importing existing customer data (manual import assumed).

## Business Domain Clarifications

### Domain: Project Management

The platform is designed for project management use cases. Business entities represent projects, tasks, and milestones with attributes including:
- Project name, description, and status
- Due dates and deadlines
- Assignees (users within the tenant)
- Progress tracking (percentage complete, task counts)
- Priority levels
- Dependencies between tasks/projects

### Subscription Tiers and Quotas

The platform implements a three-tier subscription model:

- **Free Tier**: Limited to 50 projects/tasks per tenant
- **Pro Tier**: Limited to 1,000 projects/tasks per tenant
- **Enterprise Tier**: Unlimited projects/tasks

Quota enforcement applies before entity creation. When approaching or exceeding limits, users receive upgrade prompts with clear messaging about their current usage and available tiers.

### Multi-Tenant User Model

Users can belong to multiple tenants simultaneously. Tenant identification is automatic based on URL structure:
- Subdomain-based: `tenant1.platform.com` vs `tenant2.platform.com`
- Or path-based: `platform.com/tenant1` vs `platform.com/tenant2`

The system extracts tenant context from the URL and includes it in the JWT or request context. No tenant switcher UI is required—users simply navigate to the appropriate URL for each organization.
